<p>
I have a pet bird named Mithu. He is a green parrot (an Indian Ringneck) and he has been with me for nine years. When Mithu came to me, he was just a baby, only three months old. Since then, he has become a very important part of my life. He is extremely intelligent, emotional, and talkative, and he can speak many words and sentences.
He can speaks sentences like,
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are you doing?</li>
  <li>How is the weather?</li>
  <li> How are you doing?</li>
   <li>Have you eaten food?</li>
</ul>
<p>
 He can even say a small poem that my sister taught him. He loves to call my mother “mama” and is very attached to both my mother and me. One time, when I was sick and lying in bed, Mithu looked very worried and tense. He kept looking at me and tried his best to come closer to me. It felt like he could sense that something was wrong, which shows how intelligent and caring he is.

<p>Mithu loves to eat things like,</p>

<ol>
  <li>noodles</li>
  <li>Sunflower seeds</li>
  <li>Fruits</li>
  <li>Vegetables</li>
  <li>Especially those that have seeds inside</li>
</ol>
 <p>
He is a very loving bird and behaves like a little baby. Last year, he became very sick during winter. Even though he had a warm and cozy home, he got an infection. Those were very difficult days for us. I gave him the medicines suggested by the vet, but he used to make many excuses to avoid taking them and sometimes even tried to throw them away. He really behaved like a tiny baby. Thankfully, with proper care and love, Mithu recovered and became healthy again. He is my lovely bird, my little baby, and a very special part of my life.
