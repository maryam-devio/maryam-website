# maryam-website
This project contains my first webpage using HTML and CSS.
It is about my pet bird Mithu. 
I have created this webpage that describes him, his favourite food, hobbies, my bond with him and what he can speak.
This webpage is hosted using Github pages.
I have created this website using basic HTML and CSS concepts such as,
- HTML structure (head, body, heading, paragraphs)
- Images and list (ordered and unordered list)
- div container for layout
- CSS styling (font, colours, margins, padding and alignment)
